# Official Rules

## League Play

### Weekly Matches
      
Matches are scheduled Monday through Friday nights each week of a season. Active teams will receive 1 series with evenly matched opponents each week. Schedules come out the Friday before each week. Matches that are not completed on the website by the time the scheduler runs will be deleted. A team can turn off their schedules at any time. To do so, [visit your team's leagues page](account_team_leagues_path). It can be turned back on when your team is ready to be scheduled again.

### Team Schedules

Teams are matched by rating and time available. [Team's can manage their preferred schedules here.](account_team_schedule_path) Currently, Chair League requires teams to select at least 3 days of the week they would prefer to play on. This is so we can guarantee there is a time both teams would be willing to play at.
      
### Team Timezones

Teams select timezones to play at. By default, timezones for all teams are Central Time. Timezones are used for both recruiting players and matchmaking.

- **Select Eeastern Time** if you want to play earlier in the night. (EST, INDIANA)
- **Select Central Time** if you want to play in the middle of the night.
- **Select Pacific Time** if you want to play later in the night. (PST, MST, ALASKA, HAWAII, ARIZONA)
